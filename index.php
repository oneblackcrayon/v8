				<p>Some good words about One Black Crayon</p>
				<div class="bq">
					<blockquote>
						<p><b>&#8220;</b>Few people truly know how to design and code emails that 1) accomplish objectives 2) work well on mobile devices and 3) make editing easy for the client on an ongoing basis. Frederick knows how to do all three, and he does them with impressive skill! Frederick has handled a number of projects and has always been great to work with, fast to respond, and completely reliable.</p>
						<cite>&ndash; Timothy Haines, <i>TechBridge</i></cite>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
						<p><b>&#8220;</b>I have worked with Frederick on multiple different WordPress projects and have been very impressed with his knowledge, responsiveness, and passion for development. Frederick is fun and easy to work with and I would recommend him to anyone looking for an experienced and energetic Wordpress developer.</p>
